# Lexamind02
This is a project that follows changes in laws and regulations in
different legislations across Canada. The goal is to automate
legal compliance research. 
The user can create an account and add the list of laws he wishes to be followed. When a bill brings a change to one of these laws, the system will display the bill title, its current status, and the bill content.
To create an account simply enter your email as username and choose a password.
Currently the legislations being followed are the following:
Canadian federal parliament
Ontario parliament
Alberta parliament
Quebec parliament
Quebec regulation institution
